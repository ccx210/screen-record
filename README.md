# screen-record
A screen record tool in development under windows environment using python2.7 for study.

Recently need some tools to record my screen for a program demonstration. Searching around only to find all recorders that I can access free are rather incapable for my task or inserted Trojan. Sure I can try to crack down some charged ones but It's neither easy nor polite to the authors. So I decided to develope my own.

I want something that is lite, fast and invisible while recording. In the following versions I'd like it to support more codec types and be able to work on different plantforms.
